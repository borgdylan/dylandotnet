.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the

program.
.PP
The program
.B pc2curdir
is for copying the files refernced by the "-r:*" style 'libs' variables in Mono pkg-config files to the current directory thereby allowing execution in the cases where the libraries refernced are not in the GAC.

.SH OPTIONS
Only one of the following options may be passed at one time. -h will print the help info yet it can be used together with the file-name for the input file in the same command.

.B
.IP file-name
The file name of the file having the "-r:*" style references obtained by issuing "pkg-config --libs packagename > packagename.libs"
in the form : "pc2curdir file-name.libs" ;where file-name.libs is the file mentioned before. The extension can be anything you want but .libs will identify the file as being assembly references.
.B

This option displays a short listing of the options available. If you have read all of this man page you will not need to consult the output of -h. The command is issued like this 'pc2curdir -h'.
