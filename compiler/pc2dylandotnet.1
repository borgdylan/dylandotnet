.SH NAME
pc2dylandotnet \- A program for converting pkg-config mono libs variables to dylan.NET #refasm statements.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pc2dylandotnet
.RI [-h|file-name]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the
.B pc2dylandotnet
program.
.PP
The program
.B pc2dylandotnet
is for converting the "-r:*" style 'libs' variables in Mono pkg-config files to the dylan.NET '#refasm' statements thereby allowing Mono bindings for which pkg-config files have been made to be used in dylan.NET programs with less effort.

.SH OPTIONS
Only one of the following options may be passed at one time. -h will print the help info yet it can be used together with the file-name for the input file in the same command.

.B
.IP file-name
The file name of the file having the "-r:*" style references obtained by issuing "pkg-config --libs packagename > packagename.libs"
in the form : "pc2dylandotnet file-name.libs" ;where file-name.libs is the file mentioned before. The extension can be anything you want but .libs will identify the file as being assembly references.
.B
.IP -h
This option displays a short listing of the options available. If you have read all of this man page you will not need to consult the output of -h. The command is issued like this 'pc2dylandotnet -h'.

.SH FILES
.PP
This is the list of the most important files installed by the dylan.NET Makefile or Package whichever one was used for the install. Before these paths one should add /usr/ or /usr/local/ whichever prefix was chosen in the Makefile. In package installation cases the prefix is /usr/ .

.B
.IP bin/pc2dylandotnet
The executable script which when invoked in the terminal executes the program on the mono runtime.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet-dev/pc2dn.exe
The actual program that is executed by the script. This reads in the command line arguments and writes .dyl files from the .libs files.
