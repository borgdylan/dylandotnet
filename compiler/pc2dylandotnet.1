.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the
.B pc2dylandotnet
program.
.PP
The program
.B pc2dylandotnet
is for converting the "-r:*" style 'libs' variables in Mono pkg-config files to the dylan.NET '#refasm' statements thereby allowing Mono bindings for which pkg-config files have been made to be used in dylan.NET programs with less effort.

.SH OPTIONS
-h will print the help info yet it can be used together with the file-name(s) for the input file(s) in the same command.

.B
.IP file-names
The file name(s) of the file(s) having the "-r:*" style references obtained by issuing "pkg-config --libs packagename > packagename.libs"
in the form : "pc2dylandotnet file-name.libs" ;where file-name.libs is the file mentioned before. The extension can be anything you want but .libs will identify the file as being assembly references.
.B
.IP -h
This option displays a short listing of the options available. If you have read all of this man page you will not need to consult the output of -h. The command is issued like this 'pc2dylandotnet -h'.

.SH FILES
.PP
This is the list of the most important files installed by the dylan.NET Makefile or Package whichever one was used for the install. Before these paths one should add /usr/ or /usr/local/ whichever prefix was chosen in the Makefile. In package installation cases the prefix is /usr/ .

The executable script which when invoked in the terminal executes the program on the mono runtime.
