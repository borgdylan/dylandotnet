.SH NAME
dylandotnet \- A program for compiling dylan.NET source code into Mono compatible bytecode.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dylandotnet
.RI file-name
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the
.B dylandotnet
program.
.PP
The program
.B dylandotnet
is for compiling dylan.NET code into CLI bytecode executable and/or loadable by the mono runtime.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP file-name
The file name of the file having the assembly definition and #include directives that include all the other source files is the only option to be passed on to
.B dylandotnet
in the form : "dylandotnet file-name.dyl" ;where file-name.dyl is the file mentioned before. The extension can be anything you want but .dyl will identify the file as being dylan.NET source.

.SH FILES
.PP
This is the list of the most important files installed by the dylan.NET Makefile or Package whichever one was used for the install. Before these paths one should add /usr/ or /usr/local/ whichever prefix was chosen in the Makefile. In package installation cases the prefix is /usr/ .

.B
.IP bin/dylandotnet
The dylan.NET executable script which when invoked in the terminal executes the compiler on the mono runtime.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/dnc.exe
The main dylan.NET program is what is executed by the script. This reads in the command line arguments and launches the compiler phases in sequence.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/dnu.dll
The dylan.NET utilities library housing some common functions for dylan.NET based code.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/dnr.dll
The dylan.NET reflection and reflection emit library used by the code generation phase of the compiler.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/tokenizer.AST.dll
The dylan.NET AST components library which houses all the AST parts used by the lexer and parser in order to represent inputted source code in a structure.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/tokenizer.Lexer.dll
The dylan.NET lexer library which has functions for reading a source code file and turning it in tokens and statements.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/tokenizer.Parser.dll
The dylan.NET parser library which has optimizers that can further refine the data output by the lexer library. The output is what is needed for code generation.
.B
.IP lib/dylandonet/tokenizer.CodeGen.dll
The dylan.NET code generation library which contains functions for processing the AST structure and from it make MSIL bytecode whith the help of dnr.dll.
.B
.IP share/doc/dylandonet/changelog.gz
This gzip archive contains the GIT changelog for dylan.NET. The file that is isnide is called log.txt.
.B
.IP share/doc/dylandonet/ast.tar.gz
This tarball has inside it the API documentationf for the AST library. Other such tarballs with documentation will be added in the future.
.B
.IP share/man/man1/dylandonet.1
This is this very man page for dylan.NET.
