	[ReaderWriterLockSlim] Fix for #656353. Add corresponding unit
	test.

	When in SupportsRecursion mode, a test was not including proper
	state check for short-circuiting.

	Conflicts:

	mcs/class/System.Core/System.Threading/ReaderWriterLockSlim.cs

	Turn Is*LockHeld properties into thread-specific values in
	ReaderWriterLockSlim. Add corresponding unit tests.

	Allow recursive Write + n * Read lock pattern for
	ReaderWriterLockSlim and add corresponding unit test

	Add unit tests for recursive acquire of a Write or Upgradeable
	lock from a Read lock state

	Add unit test for ReaderWriterLockSlim basic recursion support.

	Tune thread count in ReaderWriterLockSlim unit tests

	Fix ReaderWriterLockSlim unit tests.

	In the latest revision of the framework, ReaderWriterLockSlim is
	totally fair and thus a call to TryEnterReadLock musn't succeed
	when writers are waiting to get the lock before them (and when the
	lock is currently in read mode).

2010-08-31  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Fix ReaderWriterLockSlim unit tests.

	As stated by MSDN, to be fully downgraded to a read lock state a
	call to ExitUpgradableReadLock must be issued straight after
	EnterReadLock.
