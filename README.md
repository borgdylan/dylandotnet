# dylandotnet
dylan.NET compiler and related libraries

This repo has the source code for dylan.NET and its related user-facing libraries. For historical purposes some old code is also available. The current code base is split in the following folders:

* compiler - The actual dylan.NET compiler and MSBuild tooling (available in NuGet)
* MonoDevelop.DylanNet - The MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio addin
* vnext-stuff - The ASP.NET 5 tooling for dylan.NET + the Async Library for dylan.NET (both on NuGet as well)

#Moved to GitHub

Beforehand, this code was availble on gitorious and launchpad. The code will still be mirrored to those sites but the main development effort is now on GitHub. You are allowed to file issues with any problems you find and also to file pull requests. You will have to make sure that your code is LGPL 3 compatible.
