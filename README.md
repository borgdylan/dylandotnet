dylan.NET compiler and related libraries

This repo has the source code for dylan.NET and its related user-facing libraries. For historical purposes some old code is also available. The current code base is split in the following folders:

compiler - The actual dylan.NET compiler and MSBuild tooling (available in NuGet)
MonoDevelop.DylanNet - The MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio addin
vnext-stuff - The ASP.NET 5 tooling for dylan.NET + the Async Library for dylan.NET (both on NuGet as well)
